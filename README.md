# RGBL_Library

This is a library for Arduino, to program a RGB Led more easily.

To include the library just do #include <RGBL.h> , or #include "RGBL.h" .
To configure it you need to put RGBL led("Red Pin", "Green Pin", "Blue Pin");
There is only one function, and it is Color(int, int, int);

If you have any problem look at the examples, and every example has it's own fritzing example, inside the library folder/.zip .
If you can't solve this problem with that contact me trough GitHub, or by gmail. (minediversion.info@gmail.com).
